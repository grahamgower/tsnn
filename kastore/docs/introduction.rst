Introduction
============

Welcome to kastore's documentation! Kastore is a simple :ref:`storage format
<sec_format>` mapping keys to numerical arrays in a write-once-read-many
file store.  A cross platform :ref:`C API <sec_c_api>` provides programmatic
access to this file format, and there is also a convenient
:ref:`Python API <sec_python_api>` with a command line interface.

Kastore is developed as the file backing for tskit, but may
be useful in other projects that need a simple storage format
for numerical arrays with a portable C API.

.. note:: This documentation is incomplete and still under developement. If
    you would like to help, please open an issue on
    `GitHub <https://github.com/tskit-dev/kastore>`_.
